1. Algorithm for First Task: Count Words, Vowels, and Characters in a Sentence

Initialize wordCount, vowelCount, and charCount to 0
Read inputSentence which ends with a period

For each character in inputSentence:
    If character is a space:
        Increment wordCount by 1
    If character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u):
        Increment vowelCount by 1
    Increment charCount by 1

Output wordCount as the number of words
Output vowelCount as the number of vowels
Output charCount as the total characters in the sentence

2. Algorithm for Second Task: Sum of Distinct Elements from Two Sets
Given two sets of elements, find the sum of all distinct elements from the set. In other words, 
find the sum of all elements which are present in either of the given set.

Example:
Set 1 : [3, 1, 7, 9], Set 2: [2, 4, 1, 9, 3]
Output: 13 (distinct elements 4, 7, 2 )

Initialize an empty list result
Initialize set1 and set2 with the given sets of elements

For each element in set1:
    If element is not in set2:
        Add element to result
    Remove element from set1

For each element in set2:
    If element is not in set1:
        Add element to result
    Remove element from set2

Initialize sum to 0
For each element in result:
    Add element to sum

Output sum as the sum of distinct elements from both sets
